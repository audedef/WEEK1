3. Clone that repo to your computer.

I first accessed my Week 1 file with cd command
Then :
git clone https://github.com/audedef/IronAude.git


4. Create a file in that folder. Name it about.txt and add a fun fact about yourself. 

cd IronAude
touch aboutaude.txt
echo "blablabla" > aboutaude.txt



5. Add the file you just created to the git.

git add aboutaude.txt


6. Commit the changes.

git commit -m "fun fact about me"


7. Push the changes to the GitHub and check your repository to make sure everything is there.

git push origin master

ERROR :
error: src refspec master does not match any
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/audedef/IronAude.git'
(doesn't understand)

So I tried 
git push --set-upstream origin classmate

it worked

2. Clone the repository, so that you have it locally and can make changes.

git clone https://github.com/audedef/IronDmitry.git


3. Create a new branch named classmate.

git checkout -b classmate


4. Create a new file with your name (ex. maya.txt) and finish the following sentence I enrolled Ironhack's Data Analytics bootcamp because.... When you are done, save the changes.

touch aude.txt
echo "I enrolled Ironhack's Data Analytics bootcamp because.... I want to gain expertise in my current job" > aude.txt


5. Add the changes to the git.

git add aude.txt

6. Commit and push the changes.

git commit -m "pair programming ex"
git push origin master

ERROR :
error: src refspec master does not match any
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/audedef/IronAude.git'
(doesn't understand)

I tried git push and it worked.


7. Create a pull request to make changes appear in the original repository.
I pushed my commits in the wrong file "IronAude". So I moved my files from IronAude to my forked repo, IronDmitry. Then I didi again : 
git add aude.txt 
git commit -m "second try"
git push 

And it worked :) : I got my files in my forked repo in GitHub. So i was able to create a pull request to Dmitry for my two files. And the merge worked !
